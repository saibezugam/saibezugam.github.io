Hi! I'm **Sai Sukruth Bezugam**, a Ph.D. student in the **Strukov Research Group** at UC Santa Barbara (advisor: [Prof. Dmitri Strukov](https://sites.google.com/site/strukov/); previously M.S.(R) with [Prof. Manan Suri](https://web.iitd.ac.in/~manansuri/) at IIT Delhi).

I work on **device-aware neuromorphic computing**: SPICE-calibrated RRAM models, non-ideality-aware spiking algorithms, and hardware-in-the-loop prototypes (Loihi/FPGA/RTL).

**Research interests:** Low power ML, neuromorphic computing; NVM (RRAM/PCM/NOR FLASH); device→algorithm→hardware co-design; event-based vision & near-sensor processing; hardware-in-loop evaluation.
