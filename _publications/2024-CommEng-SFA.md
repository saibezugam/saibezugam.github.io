permalink: /publication/2024-CommEng-SFA
excerpt: 'The human brain''s unparalleled efficiency in executing complex cognitive tasks stems from neurons communicating via short, intermittent bursts or spikes. Spike frequency adaptation (SFA) is a fundamental neuronal mechanism that enables the dynamic adjustment of spiking rates in response to input stimuli. This process is crucial for maintaining neural homeostasis, optimizing information encoding, and preventing overstimulation. In this perspective, we explore the adaptive neuron models in computational neuroscience, emphasizing their significance in the future development of power efficient artificial intelligence applications and hardware integration. We discuss the pivotal role of spike frequency adaptation in bridging the gap between biological realism and practical utility in neuromorphic systems, thereby offering a comprehensive understanding of its potential impact on the field.'
