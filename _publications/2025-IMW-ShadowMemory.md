title: "Controlling ReRAM's Switching Characteristics with Shadow Memory for Continual Learning"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2025-IMW-ShadowMemory
excerpt: 'We propose integrating a "shadow" memristor with a synaptic memristor to adjust switching characteristics of the latter, e.g., by scaling programming voltages using a voltage divider configuration. Such adjustment allows tightening device-to-device variations in switching behavior across a chip, an essential requirement for implementing memristor-based fast (few-shot, real-time) learning neuromorphic systems. We experimentally validated our approach on two exemplary fast learning scenarios to show that it significantly improves their performance. Additionally, we demonstrate that shadow memristors help avoid catastrophic forgetting by shifting switching threshold voltages of sensitive synaptic memristors. Therefore, the proposed approach enables two key features of continual learning.'
