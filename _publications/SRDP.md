excerpt: 'Artificial synapses are fundamental building blocks for neuromorphic computing hardware. In this work, we demonstrate fully unsupervised neuromorphic learning using analog weight change properties of bilayer nonfilamentry oxide-based resistive memory (OxRAM) devices as synaptic elements. Essential functions of a biological synapse, such as potentiation, depression, and spike-rate-dependent plasticity (SRDP), are experimentally demonstrated. Furthermore, we show the tune-ability of SRDP with preneuron/postneuron spike-train parameters (frequency and amplitude). Through simulations, we show a two-layer fully connected neuromorphic network powered by SRDP and OxRAM synapses. Our network achieves state-of-the-art best classification accuracy results compared to the literature (for SRDP-based purely unsupervised spiking neural networks (SNNs), without the use of any convolutional layer) on full Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset: 92.07% (training) and 90.76% (test). Detailed impact of device properties, such as variability, retention, and endurance, is analyzed. The impact of introducing sparsity during training and weight pruning during inference was also investigated.'
