collection: publications
permalink: /publication/DEXAT
excerpt: 'We propose a Double EXponential Adaptive Threshold (DEXAT) neuron model that improves the performance of neuromorphic Recurrent Spiking Neural Networks (RSNNs) by providing faster convergence, higher accuracy and a flexible long short-term memory. We present a hardware efficient methodology to realize the DEXAT neurons using tightly coupled circuit-device interactions and experimentally demonstrate the DEXAT neuron block using oxide based non-filamentary resistive switching devices. Using experimentally extracted parameters we simulate a full RSNN that achieves a classification accuracy of 96.1% on SMNIST dataset and 91% on Google Speech Commands (GSC) dataset. We also demonstrate full end-to-end real-time inference for speech recognition using real fabricated resistive memory circuit based DEXAT neurons. Finally, we investigate the impact of nanodevice variability and endurance illustrating the robustness of DEXAT based RSNNs.'
