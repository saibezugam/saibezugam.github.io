title: "Exploiting analogue OxRAM conductance modulation for contrast enhancement application"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2020-ElectronicsLetters-OxRAM
excerpt: 'We propose a unique application of analogue oxide-based resistive memory (OxRAM) device for sensor-level information storage and computation. They show that quality of low-contrast images in low-light can be improved by carefully exploiting OxRAM conductance modulation from specific bi-layer OxRAM material stacks. The proposed methodology involves conversion of light intensity to pulse frequency followed by resistance encoding as different non-volatile OxRAM resistance states.'
