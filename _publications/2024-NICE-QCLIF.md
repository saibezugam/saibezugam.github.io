collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-NICE-QCLIF
excerpt: 'In this study, we propose the first hardware implementation of a context-based recurrent spiking neural network (RSNN) using quantized context-based leaky integrate-and-fire (QCLIF) neurons. The QCLIF neuron model is designed to efficiently capture temporal dependencies in sequential data while maintaining low hardware complexity. We present a detailed hardware architecture for the QCLIF neuron and demonstrate its implementation in a 45nm CMOS technology. Our results show that the proposed RSNN achieves competitive accuracy on sequential learning tasks while significantly reducing hardware area and power consumption compared to existing RSNN implementations. This work paves the way for energy-efficient neuromorphic computing systems capable of processing temporal information in real-time applications.'
