permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'The authors present a unique application of analogue oxide-based resistive memory (OxRAM) device for sensor-level information storage and computation. They show that quality of low-contrast images in low-light can be improved by carefully exploiting OxRAM conductance modulation from specific bi-layer OxRAM material stacks. The proposed methodology involves conversion of light intensity to pulse frequency followed by resistance encoding as different non-volatile OxRAM resistance states.'
