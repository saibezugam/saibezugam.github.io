collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023-DRC-OnSensor
excerpt: 'This work presents a proof-of-concept application of a memristive-type oxide-based RRAM device for the on-sensor preprocessing of visual data. The proposed hybrid (CMOS-RRAM) sensor architecture improves the contrast quality of low-light low-contrast visual data, as an early visual task by carefully exploiting bilayer analogue RRAM''s conductance modulation. This work also investigates the impact of RRAM device''s conductance state variability on the contrast enhancement and shows negligible change in the results. An artificial neural network (ANN) of architecture 64×20×3 (with three different output classes) is built to perform the image classification and shows ∼ 74% better efficiency with RRAM based preprocessed data. The proposed hybrid sensor architecture and methodology is a step toward the development of advanced, intelligent visual systems of the next generation.'
